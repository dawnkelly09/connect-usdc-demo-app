This demo application integrates Wormhole Connect into a Next.js with TypeScript project to create a simple application for sending USDC from Sepolia to the Solana test network. Wormhole Connect is a customizable React widget for Wormhole-powered cross-chain asset transfers. 

This build is based upon the "Alice & Bobâ€™s Cross-Chain Reimbursement App with Wormhole Connect" from the [Wormhole Dev Arena](https://arena.wormhole.com/), powered by Hackquest.

A demo version of this application is [deployed to Vercel](https://connect-usdc-demo-app.vercel.app/) if you'd like to see it or try a testnet transaction. 

You can learn more about Connect by visiting the [Wormhole Connect](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect) repository.
